# Final Project: Data Science Tools and Techniques

```

## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate the application of various data science tools and techniques. In this notebook, we will explore different programming languages, libraries, and tools used in the field of data science, as well as perform basic arithmetic operations and data transformations.



## Data Science Programming Languages
The most commonly used programming languages in data science include:
- Python
- R
- SQL
- Julia
- Scala


## Data Science Libraries
Some popular libraries used in data science are:
- **NumPy**: for numerical computing
- **Pandas**: for data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: for data visualization
- **Seaborn**: for statistical data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: for machine learning
- **TensorFlow**: for deep learning

## Data Science Tools

| Tool           | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Jupyterlite    | An online tool for creating interactive notebooks |
| GitHub         | A platform for version control and sharing code |
| TensorFlow     | A deep learning framework                   |
| Apache Spark   | A big data processing framework             |
| Tableau        | A data visualization tool                   |
                             

## Arithmetic Expressions
Examples of arithmetic operations include:
- Addition: `2 + 3 = 5`
- Subtraction: `5 - 3 = 2`
- Multiplication: `2 * 3 = 6`
- Division: `6 / 3 = 2`


```python
# Multiplication and Addition
a = 5
b = 3

multiplication_result = a * b
addition_result = a + b

multiplication_result, addition_result
```
